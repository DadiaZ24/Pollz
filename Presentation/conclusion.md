# PollZ Platform

The PollZ project is a robust and scalable polling application built using modern frameworks and following the Onion Architecture. It ensures a clear separation of concerns, making the codebase maintainable and testable. The use of React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS on the frontend provides a responsive and interactive user experience, while ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework Core on the backend ensure reliable and efficient data management.
